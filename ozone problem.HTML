  <h1 style="color: lightblue;">    what is happening to our ozone layer!!!
  </h1>
  <h2>
    what is realy happening?
  </h2>
  <i><b>Ozone depletion, gradual thinning of Earth’s ozone layer in the upper atmosphere caused by the release of chemical compounds containing gaseous chlorine or bromine from industry and other human activities. The thinning is most pronounced in the polar regions, especially over Antarctica. Ozone depletion is a major environmental problem because it increases the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches Earth’s surface, which increases the rate of skin cancer, eye cataracts, and genetic and immune system damage. The Montreal Protocol, ratified in 1987, was the first of several comprehensive international agreements enacted to halt the production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals. As a result of continued international cooperation on this issue, the ozone layer is expected to recover over time.</b></i>
  <h3>
    what is the chemical causing this?

        <h2>what is the chemical</h2>
        <p><i><b>These compounds contribute to ozone depletion, and are called ozone-depleting substances ( ODS. ODS include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, methyl bromide, carbon tetrachloride, hydrobromofluorocarbons, chlorobromomethane, and methyl chloroform.</b> </i></p>

    <div class="column">
        <h2>where does it come from?</h2>
        <p><i><b>Many people have heard that the ozone hole is caused by chemicals called CFCs, short for chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs escape into the atmosphere from refrigeration and propellant devices and processes. In the lower atmosphere, they are so stable that they persist for years, even decades.</b></i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
        <h2>how does it affect the ozone layer</h2>
        <p> <b><i>Ozone Depletion. When chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone in the stratosphere, they destroy ozone molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created.</b></i></p>
